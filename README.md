## Project 1: Introduction to Data Science - Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits

This work aims to follow the CRISP-DM process, exhibit my technical abilities, and communicate insights in the form of a blog post.

 I chose this topic as personal interest to better understand factors that influence a well run business and methods to influence consumer behavior.
