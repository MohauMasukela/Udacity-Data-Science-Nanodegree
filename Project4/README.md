# Sparkify: Predicting Churn for a Music Streaming Service




## Installations

- Matplotlib.pyplot, Matplotlib.ticker
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Project Motivation


For this project i was able to predict churn for for a music streaming company called Sparkify, the project involved:
- Loading and cleaning a small subset of data where the full dataset of 12GB is available
- Conducting EDA to understand the data and what features could be used
- Creating feautures that would assist in the modelling
- Predicting using alogorithims like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boost

## Medium Blog Post

The findings on the code can be found on my [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@mohaumasukela/reasons-for-customer-churn-prediction-with-pyspark-e376e838cfba) which will explain the details of the the project . Gradient Boost Classifier has been chosen as the best model
