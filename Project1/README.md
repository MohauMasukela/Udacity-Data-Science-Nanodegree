# Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits




## Project Motivation

For this project i was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using the Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset which can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/code)

The questions that i will be answering are as follows:

- How do promos and discounts influence the purchasing behavior of consumers? 
  
-  I want to find out what influences the frequency of purchase, as a business it is important to have returning customers to garantee the longevity of the business
  
- What are the most item purchases  and why? As business that information is critical to keep the inventory updated on the clients preferences

The link to my jupyter notebook code and all relevent EDA analysis will be found [here](/Project1/ConsumerBehaviorAnalysis.ipynb)
