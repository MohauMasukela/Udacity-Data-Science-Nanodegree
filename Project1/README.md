# Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits




## Project Motivation

For this project i was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using the Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset which can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/code)

The questions that i will be answering are as follows:

- How do promos and discounts influence the purchasing behavior of consumers? 
  
-  I want to find out what influences the frequency of purchase, as a business it is important to have returning customers to garantee the longevity of the business
  
- What are the most item purchases  and why? As business that information is critical to keep the inventory updated on the clients preferences
